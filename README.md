# FAH Client Code

## Usage
 This code was specifically decompiled for installation on OpenShift Online. 
 
 ## IMPORTANT NOTICE: 
 I created this repo only for usage on RedHat OpenShift Online. Don't distribute this software. All rights go to F@H. I'm not trying to damage F@H or any of its property in any way. I'm actually trying to help F@H with more work units. This repo is public only because I couldn't figure out how to insert SSH keys in OpenShift. This repository will be made private ASAP.
